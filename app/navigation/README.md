### Navigation

This project uses [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) to manage the navigation of the app, and the files used to do it lives here.

React Navigation provides an easy to use navigation solution, with the ability to present common stack navigation and tabbed navigation patterns on both iOS and Android. As this is a JavaScript implementation, it provides the greatest amount of configurability as well as flexibility when integrating with state management libraries such as redux.
